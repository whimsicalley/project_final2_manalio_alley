## Resources

* [Visuallyhidden boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169)

    Used to visually hide headings that are semantically useful, and screen readers need.

* [3 Ways to Style Links with CSS](http://www.theblogmarket.co/css-html-styling-links/)

    Following the presentation, you really stressed the use of underlining our links. While I generally hate this look, I tried to find a style that didn't bother me so much. Enter this article, which suggested using a thicker border-bottom rather than the default underline.

* [Increase gap between text and underline](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1734618/how-to-increase-the-gap-between-text-and-underlining-in-css)

    I still wasn't entirely satisfied with the look of the border bottom, so I was happy to find this article about simply adding a padding-bottom. It made a surprisingly nice difference.
