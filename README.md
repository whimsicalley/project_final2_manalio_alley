## Resources

* [Visuallyhidden boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169)

    Used to visually hide headings that are semantically useful, and screen readers need.

* [3 Ways to Style Links with CSS](http://www.theblogmarket.co/css-html-styling-links/)

    Following the presentation, you really stressed the use of underlining our links. While I generally hate this look, I tried to find a style that didn't bother me so much. Enter this article, which suggested using a thicker border-bottom rather than the default underline.

* [Increase gap between text and underline](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1734618/how-to-increase-the-gap-between-text-and-underlining-in-css)

    I still wasn't entirely satisfied with the look of the border bottom, so I was happy to find this article about simply adding a padding-bottom. It made a surprisingly nice difference.

## Comments

1. I think my spacing looks okay for the most part, but I was definitely having some margin problems where the margins of different elements were overtaking each other. I couldn't remember how to remedy this other than setting box-sizing to border-box. I think this was most obvious between the images and buttons, but the buttons in general were a pain. I tried everything I could think of to put more space between the end of the paragraph and the buttons but it's still a little close for my liking.
